urly_tiny is a collaborative project between Geneva Skeen (@geneeves) and Brittany 'Jazzy' Winston (@tallgirltaadaa), during Fall 2013 at Epicodus [http://www.epicodus.com]. urly_tiny is a url shortener. Enjoy!

NOTE: This was partially an exercise in rolling our own user authentication without Devise, and is nominally secure. I recommend using an easy-to-remember dummy email address and password for the time being.
