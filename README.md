URLyTiny is a collaborative project between Geneva Skeen (@geneeves) and Brittany 'Jazzy' Winston (@tallgirltaadaa), during Fall 2013 at Epicodus [http://www.epicodus.com]. URLyTiny is a url shortener which tracks the number of views you've had on a link. 

Try it out [here](http://www.urlytiny.herokuapp.com). Enjoy!


NOTE: This was partially an exercise in rolling our own user authentication without Devise, and is nominally secure. I recommend using an easy-to-remember dummy email address and password for the time being.

Also, it is currently deployed on Heroku so the generated URL is longer than ideally useful. This would be easy to fix with the purchase of a shorter domain name.
